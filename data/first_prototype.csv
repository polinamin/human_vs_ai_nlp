1,Quitting after 8 years without notice. Am I wrong?,"You are not wrong.
Loyalty is a two-way street.

Even the biggest jerks I have worked for have recognized that family emergencies and health emergencies come first.","Quitting a job without notice after eight years can be seen as unprofessional and may have negative consequences for your reputation and future job prospects. It is generally recommended to provide notice when resigning from a position, as it allows your employer to make necessary arrangements and find a replacement. However, there may be exceptional circumstances where quitting without notice is unavoidable, such as in cases of extreme mistreatment or unsafe working conditions. It is important to carefully consider the potential impact of your decision and weigh the pros and cons before taking such action."

Subject: Request for Adjusting Morning Communication

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss a small adjustment regarding our morning communication routine. While I understand the importance of staying updated on the team's status, I believe there might be a more efficient and less interruptive way for us to achieve this.

Recently, I've noticed that whenever my team's status changes in the morning, I receive an immediate call from you. While I appreciate your attention and concern, these calls can sometimes interrupt my workflow and make it challenging for me to focus on my tasks. I believe there might be alternative methods for us to stay connected while still ensuring effective communication.

I propose that we explore more structured and scheduled check-ins throughout the day or a daily summary email that highlights any significant updates or changes in our team's progress. This"
6,I had a 90k salary and now making 38k. Any advice?,"Hey man I was in a similar position years ago. Was making 60k, then was long term unemployed and ended up having to take something at 25k to survive, and now I am up to 200k/year. 

What I did was never stop trying. It’s a very long and frustrating process, but doing whatever you can to improve yourself in the short term is vital. You’ll be tired from the gig you’ve got, but don’t stop applying. Branch out to other types of roles or locations you’ve been excluding that could be tangentially related to your previous role. Continue professional growth on your own time as well so you aren’t seen as falling behind in the industry. 

I’m on my 3rd different career, but once I found this I have found ways to stay in the industry. To get from 25k back up I took an entry level role in the field I was at a higher level in before layoffs. I went through the paces and worked my way back up. I had 6 years in the industry and still had to work with fresh college grads when starting over. I leveraged that into a new job at a different company less than a year later and just kept clawing my way back up through my performance and personal growth. 

The job you’re at now is the humbling experience so don’t feel like you’re lowering yourself to start at the bottom again. You’ll get there, but remember that you may need to have short term more attainable goals for now. This is a marathon and not a sprint.

2. Prioritize expenses: Rank your expenses based on importance and allocate your limited funds accordingly. Ensure that essential bills are paid on time to avoid any additional fees or penalties.

3. Reduce debt: If you have any outstanding debts, such as credit card balances or loans, consider creating a plan to pay them off gradually. Explore options like debt consolidation or negotiating with creditors to potentially lower interest rates or monthly payments.

19,"I signed a contract offer for a new job, then future boss called me with ""new information"". Can I rescind?","Their “update” is a major modification of the agreed contract terms. If it makes you feel better, have the offer letter reviewed by an employment lawyer, but don’t be surprised when they come back and tell you, “yeah, you can rescind your agreement”. Me? I wouldn’t bother with the lawyer. I’d just sent them a terse and professional, 

“Due to material changes to the job offer that were not revealed until I accepted the position, I am rescinding my candidacy for the role and will not be accepting the position at this time. Please note that while I was excited for the opportunity, the start date and job site location for the role were major contributing factors in my acceptance of your offer for employment. As these terms have changed my acceptance has as well. Good luck in your candidate search.”

Edit: As has been pointed out, there is a _chance_ this is a simple misunderstanding or mistake on the part of the employer. Even if that is the case, and even if the role otherwise seems perfect, I would argue that this sort of event shows either gross incompetence or complete disregard for your own personal and professional boundaries. This all also applies whether it’s an actual contract offer or simply an employment offer. In either case, they’re materially altering the agreement after you signed it and trying to make that your problem to deal with. It isn’t.

Even if the job looks like a dream, strongly consider if that’s the sort of employer you want to yoke your work:life balance to before accepting any sort of, “my bad” or “just kidding” arguments. I know I wouldn’t.

Second edit: Thanks for all the recognition folks, it’s appreciated. 😳🥹🥹 That is all.","I am not a lawyer, but I can offer some general information that may be helpful. Rescinding a job offer acceptance or a signed contract can have legal implications, and it is important to review the contract and seek legal advice specific to your situation. 

In some cases, job offers or contracts may include clauses that allow for rescission or termination under certain conditions. These conditions could include changes in the job description, salary, benefits, or other important terms. If the ""new information"" provided by your future boss significantly alters the terms of the contract, it may be worth reviewing the contract and seeking legal advice to understand your options.

However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of rescinding a signed contract. This may include damaging your professional reputation, potential legal action from the employer, or other negative outcomes. Therefore, it is advisable to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance based on your specific circumstances and the laws applicable to your jurisdiction."

Why would this give leverage for more severance? You are already laid off and now going to a competitor? This is not something you want to disclose and make sure you are legally allowed to work there before anything.","Deciding whether to meet with a competitor after being laid off is a personal decision that depends on multiple factors. Consider the following points before making a decision:

1. Non-compete agreements: If you signed a non-compete clause with your previous employer, meeting with a competitor may violate the terms of that agreement. Review your employment contract or consult legal advice to understand any limitations.

2. Ethical considerations: Evaluate whether meeting with a competitor aligns with your personal and professional ethics. Some individuals may feel uncomfortable meeting with a direct competitor due to loyalty or ethical concerns.

3. Career goals: Assess if the competitor's offer aligns with your long-term career goals. Consider the potential for growth, learning opportunities, and advancement within the new company.

You: that's private   

You're not obligated to share personal details if you don't want to.","There could be several reasons why someone without kids may not be able to cover for their coworker. Here are a few possible explanations:

1. Personal Commitments: Just because someone doesn't have children doesn't mean they don't have other commitments or responsibilities outside of work. They may have personal engagements, appointments, or other obligations that prevent them from covering for their coworker.

2. Workload: It's possible that the person without kids already has a heavy workload or is working on important projects that require their full attention. Taking on additional responsibilities might not be feasible without compromising their own work.

3. Lack of Expertise: Covering for a coworker may require specific knowledge or skills that the person without kids doesn't possess. They may not be the most suitable replacement and could potentially cause more harm than good by attempting to cover.

2. Work-life balance: Consider the potential impact on your work-life balance. A management job may come with increased responsibilities, longer hours, and higher stress levels. Will the higher salary compensate for the potential loss of work-life balance and increased stress?

65,"Does anyone feel like people (millennials, etc.) are lacking a purpose?","A consequence of the availability of information is the ability to consume. In the developed world, we are experiencing a shift closer toward consumer lifestyles and away from producer lifestyles. Watching TV, people dancing on TikTok, playing games, and getting bad advice on social media are more popular past times than pursuing a trade or craft. Those who produce are becoming fewer.

Not suggesting a consumer lifestyle society is bad, per se. Let's consider a person who is conditioned to live a consumer lifestyle. If the things they consume do not change fast enough, they can feel increased stagnation or purposelessness over time. It becomes difficult to overcome their boredom. Producers, on the other hand, create their own experiences to consume. While flexible, this can also be a major drag because it can become a lot of work. Producers can feel the same stagnation or purposelessness. For one to overcome ""purposelessness,"" I believe they need a balance of producing and consuming.

Take the L and learn from it my friend and good luck to you.]

In 2016 I got fired from a call center job (job A) for not meeting performance expectations. I was there a year shy a day. I never worked in that particular industry again, as I felt it wasn’t for me and the experience in job A was overall not great. 

I continued to put it on my resume as I was offered a reference from my team manager from job A. When asked at a later interview for a job in a different industry (job B), I was up front with the interviewers and said that I was let go due to my inability to meet performance expectations in that role. I said that I put in all available efforts, but at the end of the day I turned out to be an incorrect fit, and I emphasized on the things that I took away from the role and how grateful I was to have the experience. I tried to speak highly of it regardless of the fact I was let go. I ended up getting job B with that answer (not because of).

A business analyst spends their time communicating requirements for some kind of business change, usually process changes, software changes, and database changes. It is all about making communication happen between functional teams that dont really understand each others work. Your legal team and you software team are going to view a problem differently. A business analyst would make sure they understand all the requirements and make sure that the change meets them. 

As an example, when I worked as a business analyst, I was notified that our autodialer, the robocaller we used to send voicemails out to customers, was not calling some customers. It was job to find out why and see that it was fixed, identify any possible risks (like did we do something illegal) and address them. I wrote a lot of documents to track the project so if I was hit by a bus another analyst could continue my work. 

It really was a bunch of meetings, analytics, drawing pictures for people who don’t like to read, etc.

I think the piece that you might be missing is business acumen. Its easy to have a bullshit job if your team is generating millions of dollars or preventing the loss of millions. In some jobs, if you’re not doing anything, that means business is good. Like risk management. If everything is going according to plan, then there isn’t really much to do. Think of it like an insurance plan. Would you pay an $80k salary if it prevented $200M of penalties and expenses in complying with audits? It always comes back to how much money you’re making for the business. If you wanted to make more money, you would want to get in a position where you are responsible for more money.

After I shared my current salary she said ""you can only expect 20% above what you are currently making"". But the companies budget is double!?",Never share your current salary. Your statement should be “I would need to make X to make this change.”,"It's not uncommon for recruiters or hiring managers to provide a salary range based on a candidate's current salary. While it may seem unfair in cases where the budget is higher, there can be various reasons behind this approach. Here are a few possible explanations:

1. Salary guidelines: Some companies have strict policies or guidelines that dictate how much of a salary increase can be offered to a candidate. These guidelines may be based on factors such as the candidate's current salary, experience level, or internal equity considerations.

2. Market standards: Recruiters often use a candidate's current salary as a starting point to gauge their expectations and align them with market standards. While the company's budget may allow for a larger increase, they may aim to offer a competitive salary within the market range, rather than solely based on their budget.

3. Negotiation room: By offering a 20% increase above your current salary, the recruiter may be leaving room for negotiation. They may be open to discussing a higher salary"

Financial stability: Evaluate your current financial situation and determine if a 5k reduction in salary would significantly impact your ability to meet your financial obligations or achieve your financial goals. If the 5k reduction is manageable and won't cause significant financial strain, it might be worth considering.

2. Quality of life: Consider the value of your time and the impact of a shorter commute on your overall well-being. Spending less time commuting can provide more time for personal activities, family, hobbies, or relaxation, which can improve your work-life balance and overall happiness.

To answer some of yours (and others) questions:

It's probably unrealistic to expect to be able to teach with your current experience. I would plan on getting a teaching degree if you want to do that. The only reason some MD's teach, despite not having teaching degrees, is that they have years of medical experience beyond residency.

I would also recommend against applying to a different sort of clinical program (PA, RN, Etc.).  Your experience likely won't transfer over, despite obviously being applicable, and you will have to start from the very beginning. If you know it's what you want to do then do it, but expect to be starting from scratch.

2. Seek guidance: Talk to your academic advisor, mentors, or trusted individuals who can provide guidance and support. They can help you assess your options and explore alternative career paths that align with your interests and strengths.

3. Consider other healthcare professions: There are numerous healthcare professions outside of medicine that you might find rewarding.

1. Internal sources: If you discussed your job search or the potential job offer with colleagues, friends, or anyone within your current workplace, there is a chance that the information could have reached your employer through gossip or unintentional leaks.

2. Background checks: Some employers conduct background checks on their employees, especially when they are leaving the company. These checks may include verifying your new employment details, which could reveal that you accepted a job at a competitor.

3. Reference checks: If the new employer contacted your current employer for a reference check, your current employer would have learned about your job acceptance during the conversation.

At least the production workers got OT.

Here are a few factors to consider before making a decision:

1. Relevance: Assess whether the reason for your termination 14 years ago is still relevant to the job you are currently applying for. If the termination was due to a specific performance issue that is no longer relevant or if you have since gained significant experience and skills, it may not be necessary to disclose it.

2. Job application requirements: Review the application or job requirements carefully. Some applications may specifically ask about previous terminations, in which case you should answer honestly. However, if the application does not ask about terminations, you may not be obligated to disclose the information.

120,I'm a teacher--can I buy vending machines over the next few years to create a zero-staff low-labor semi-passive income? I just really hate working and would like to do it less.,"A basic vending machine can cost 1-2k. The fancier ones can go up to 5k-10k, with the top tier ones being even more than that.

In an area with decent foot traffic, you're looking at a few hundred a month per machine in profit after taking out electricity and overhead costs, though in a heavy traffic area could hit the thousands (think airport, subway station, etc)

You'd need at least 10-15 machines to be able to really ""live"" off it, and understand that this isn't ""passive"" income. You're doing a route visiting every machine at least once a day, though those heavy traffic areas might need a refill twice or thrice daily.

Once you hit a few dozen machines is when you start to make the big bucks, but also when you need to think about hiring someone to help out. 

SOURCE: Worked at a large hospital with an absurd amount of machines (~~at least 20~~ EDIT: at least 3-4 dozen) owned by a local guy, talked to him a few times while he restocked the frozen microwave meal vending machine lol.","As a teacher, it is understandable that you may want to explore additional income opportunities. Investing in vending machines can be a potential source of semi-passive income, but there are several factors to consider:

1. Research and planning: Before making any investments, thoroughly research the vending machine market, including the types of machines available, locations, and potential profitability. Develop a solid business plan to ensure you make informed decisions.

2. Capital investment: Purchasing vending machines requires a significant upfront investment. You'll need to consider the costs of acquiring the machines, stocking them with products, and maintaining them. Additionally, you may need to invest in insurance and permits.

3. Location and maintenance: The success of vending machines heavily relies on their placement. Securing suitable locations with high foot traffic is crucial. You will also need to regularly restock and maintain the machines, ensuring they are in working order and stocked with fresh products.

4. Time commitment: While vending machines can be considered semi-passive income,"

It is possible that you haven't fully developed these skills yet or are still adjusting to their importance in a professional setting.

2. Lack of experience: School and college provide a controlled environment where you receive guidance and feedback from teachers and professors. In the workplace, you may face unfamiliar challenges and have to make decisions independently. It takes time to gain experience and adapt to the expectations of a job.

It's sort of passive aggressive for him to do this but perhaps you can ask him what he thinks of your performance so far. You should be able to be honest with your manager.

Consider whether you genuinely didn't know the answer to the technical question or if nerves got the best of you. Identifying the reason behind your reaction can help you address it for future interviews.

2. Reach out to the interviewer: If you feel comfortable, you can consider reaching out to the interviewer to explain your actions. Apologize for leaving abruptly and express your interest in the position.

Any advice on how I can help him?","I’d tell him to forget about the big companies, and to take a calculated step “back” before pursuing a management role.  He needs relevant recent experience to connect his ability to a prospective employer.

He should identify jobs he wants and isn’t getting.  Identify a job that will create a bridge to those types of jobs.  The nice thing about local companies is that you can often actively take on more responsibility and build up your resume, vs a corporate job where your role is kind of your role.  

For example, if he wants to work for a power tool company, work for a local company that sells power tools in a customer facing role.  The barrier to entry is low and there is always need.  Gradually ask for more responsibilities like purchasing, merchandising, deliveries, or whatever.  Then apply to the power tool company, now that he has relevant experience.","It's understandable that you feel concerned about your dad's situation. While you may not have direct control over his job search, there are some ways you can support and help him during this challenging time. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Offer emotional support: Let your dad know that you're there for him, that you care about his well-being, and that you understand how difficult this situation is for him. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to and share their frustrations with can be comforting.

135,Can we all agree to normalize gaps on resumes?,I have a 1.5 year gap on my resume and it’s never been an issue.,"As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide some insights on the topic. Normalizing gaps on resumes is a subjective matter that can vary depending on individual circumstances and cultural contexts. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. Changing attitudes: In recent years, there has been a shift in attitudes towards resume gaps. Employers are becoming more understanding of breaks in employment due to various reasons such as personal development, family responsibilities, mental health, or career transitions.

2. Transparency and honesty: It is important for candidates to be transparent and honest about any gaps in their resumes. Instead of trying to hide or cover up the gaps, candidates can explain the reasons behind them and highlight any valuable experiences or skills gained during that time.

3. Focus on skills and achievements: Emphasizing skills, achievements, and relevant experiences can help mitigate the impact of resume gaps. By highlighting what you have accomplished during your professional career, you can demonstrate your capabilities and potential"
136,Used the word ‘subordinate’ in an email. Did not know it is taboo to use it in America. Is this grounds for termination?,"You're fine. It's not the _most_ respectful word to use for your reports/directs, but it's not on the level of being offensive.","The use of the word ""subordinate"" in an email, without any additional context, is unlikely to be grounds for termination in itself. However, it is important to be aware that certain language choices can be seen as negative or derogatory in a professional setting.

In the United States, the term ""subordinate"" can sometimes be viewed as demeaning or hierarchical, implying an unequal power dynamic. It is generally recommended to use more neutral or inclusive language when referring to colleagues or team members, such as ""colleague,"" ""team member,"" or ""direct report.""

If this is the first instance and there were no malicious intentions behind using the term, it is more likely that a supervisor or HR representative may provide guidance or feedback on appropriate language usage. However, repeated or intentional use of derogatory language could potentially lead to disciplinary action, depending on the company's policies and the severity of the situation.

It's always important to be mindful of cultural norms, workplace policies, and respectful communication practices to"

Think about your life as if it was on a geologic timescale. You are in a moment of intense pressure but this might not be the case forever. In fact, many rocks face pressure during their metamorphism. Here's the fun part: you are not a rock. You have agency and can decide how this pressure transforms you. As you know, rocks can travel vast distances and wind up in entirely new places you wouldn't always expect to find them. That includes rocks that have been chilling in the pits of the earth and still make their way up to the surface. You'll figure this out, You Rock!","I'm not a legal expert, but I can offer some general advice. It depends on the specific circumstances and the laws in your country or state. In some cases, if you voluntarily quit your job, your employer may have the right to rescind a job offer without legal consequences.

They can help you understand your rights and determine if any legal action can be taken."

Do NOT tell them. This is a management problem. They’re a mess- but it’s not your mess. You tell them and they’ll let you go. They’ll blame it on whatever the PIP is for.

139,What’s a skill i can learn rn that’ll get me out of poverty?,"It’s a very generic answer, but with a little hidden secret most people don’t think about

Trades - plumbing, HVAC, electrician, but in the **hospital setting** (stationary engineering or facility management is what they are normally called where I’m at). Depending on where you live and if they are unionized there, they make a *killing*.

Where I live (california), they start out at around $62-$68/hr depending on region and there’s almost always positions available. With on-call and any OT needed, you’re clearing $150k/yr easily. If you have Local 39 in your area, they should have an apprenticeship program too to gain experience if needed.

My last hospital I worked at tried to recruit me for an open position. When I told them I didn’t have much HVAC experience, they said that they do on the job training and have 90 days to take an HVAC test (even with my limited knowledge, I could have passed it).

Just a suggestion. Most people don’t know that facility maintenance at hospitals is fairly lucrative for anyone with a trade skill set. Plus if it’s at a good health system, you’re usually saving a **ton** of money on healthcare benefits. It’s usually extremely cheap or sometimes *free* and only pay when you have a visit and pay copays and whatnot.","There are several skills you can learn that may help improve your financial situation and potentially move you out of poverty.

However, without more specific information about your situation, it's challenging to provide a precise answer. Here are a few common reasons for being rejected after a final interview:

1. Lack of skills or experience: The company might have found another candidate who had more relevant skills or experience for the position. It's possible that they determined the other candidate would be a better fit for their needs.

2. Cultural fit: Companies often consider cultural fit when making hiring decisions. If they believed another candidate would integrate better with their team or company culture, they might have chosen them over you.

They collected the JD and called a meeting, flashed it on the screen and everyone read through it.

After a moment's silence a guy says

""Boss I don't think any of us qualify for this job.""","Job descriptions often make every job sound more difficult for several reasons:

1. Attracting the right candidates: Employers want to attract the most competent and qualified individuals for the job. By emphasizing the challenges and complexity of the role, they can deter underqualified or uninterested candidates from applying. It helps to filter out those who may not be up to the task.

2. Setting expectations: Employers want to ensure that potential candidates have a clear understanding of the job's requirements and responsibilities. By highlighting the difficulties, they can manage expectations and ensure that candidates are prepared for the challenges they may face.

3. Differentiating from similar roles: In a competitive job market, companies want to stand out and attract top talent. By exaggerating the difficulty or uniqueness of a role, they can differentiate it from similar positions in other organizations.

2. Work-life balance: Assess how important the flexibility of a fully remote job is to you. If you highly value the ability to work from anywhere and have a better work-life balance, think about whether the potential increase in salary outweighs these benefits.

155,Is 75k still the base to be happy?,"That idea is over 10 years old and outdated. But it has endured because it answered a fundamental question: how much money buys happiness? The idea stuck and and dollar number froze into mainstream common knowledge.

The original theory was from a study published in 2010 examining a Gallup survey conducted in 2008 and 2009. Keep in mind, the US experienced a financial crisis and housing crash in 2008. Today, the US is headed into another recession caused by high inflation and economic over-rebound from the the 2020 pandemic. 

Now, back in 2008/2009, a person making USD $75K/year would have been between the 11th and 12th percentile of top earners. Today, someone in that same rank would need to make USD $105K/year to feel the same sense of happiness. If we define by just inflation alone, it would be about $102K/year.

For me personally, I would say USD $90K (dual income, no kids, high COL). That is when I stopped stressing about bills/debts/financial strain and tuned my effort to savings/wealth/risky investments. Once I had my 6-months of emergency savings in place, I felt safe, protected, and secure from income loss/uncertainty.","The concept of a ""base"" salary for happiness varies greatly depending on individual circumstances, personal preferences, and the cost of living in a particular area. While $75,000 per year may be considered a comfortable income for many people, it does not guarantee happiness for everyone. Happiness is subjective and can be influenced by various factors such as relationships, health, personal fulfillment, and overall life satisfaction. It is important to remember that financial stability alone does not determine happiness, and individuals have different needs and aspirations that go beyond a specific income level."

1. High competition: Many individuals aspire to work in white-collar professions, resulting in a large pool of qualified candidates. This high level of competition makes it difficult to stand out among other applicants, even with a relevant degree.

2. Limited job opportunities: The number of available positions in white-collar fields may not be sufficient to accommodate the large number of graduates each year. This limited job market increases the difficulty of finding suitable employment.

3. Experience requirements: While having a relevant degree is important, many white-collar jobs also require relevant work experience. Without prior experience, it can be challenging to convince employers of your capabilities and suitability for the role.

2. Focus on the positive aspects: Instead of dwelling on the negatives, make a conscious effort to focus on the positive aspects of your career. Identify what you enjoy about your work, the skills you've developed, or the opportunities it provides. Shifting your attention to the positive can help reframe your mindset.

Additionally, physical appearance can contribute to self-confidence and self-esteem, impacting an individual's overall well-being. Feeling satisfied with one's appearance can positively affect mental health and social interactions.

The purpose of a layoff is to insulate executives from the consequences of their own mistakes. When layoff time comes, you're just the insulation.","Opinions on coding can vary greatly among individuals.

These benefits are intended to provide additional value beyond the employee's salary and contribute to their overall well-being. However, there may be cases where companies do not fully honor the benefits they offer. There could be several reasons for this:

1. Cost-cutting measures: Companies may cut costs by reducing or eliminating certain benefits to save money. This can be due to financial difficulties, economic downturns, or changes in business strategies.

2. Miscommunication or misunderstanding: Sometimes, there can be miscommunication or misunderstanding between the company and the employee regarding the benefits offered. It could be due to unclear policies, inadequate communication channels, or lack of awareness on the employee's part.

3. Legal or contractual limitations: Companies may be bound by legal or contractual obligations that restrict them from fully honoring certain benefits. These limitations could be a result of specific laws, regulations, or agreements with third-party providers.

346,I’m at my wit’s end. Is the market really this bad?,"I have 6-7 years of good experience (depending on if you count my relevant job in college) and I had to apply to about (literally) 600 hundred jobs. Got ~15 callbacks, 4 interviews, 3 offers. Arguably, it’s a better market for someone like me than you

If you’ll take any relevant job that will pay the bills , here’s my advice

1. Make yourself open to work on Linked In. Almost always if a head hunter reaches out, you can get an interview.

2. Blow up those skills on Ljnked In. List every little skill, language, tool, code editor you know. Recruiters will filter for candidates matching certain skill sets so the more you have the more likely you will appear

3. Don’t waste time on applying on Linked In though. I applied to maybe 100 jobs on there and never even got a callback. Focus on indeed, zip recruiter, etc.

3. Apply for any job that is close to your salary expectation, duty expectation, and where you meet 50% ish or more of what their asking for. My current job wanted 7 years, and terraform. I didn’t have terraform or 7 years in industry, but I met the role pretty well otherwise so it was worth applying even though I didn’t have their year count 

4. Have a “pretty” version of every resume for humans (only send to humans directly who ask for it directly from you) and a “parseable” one for blind job applications. Most resumes get auto parsed on the job tools and the hr websites into sone meta record in their database so if a robot can’t read your resume you won’t get through the auto parser. A good way to generate one of these is to fill out an indeed profile then print your indeed resume. It’s simple, parseable, and to the point 

5. You’ll want about 3 resume versions, front end focused, backend focused, full stack focused, for all the types of engineering roles you’d be willing to work 

6. Quantity over quality. Generally jobs that want a cover letter, 60 pre-screen questions, etc. I didn’t hear back from, so don’t waste your time on those. Frankly, you could submit 1 “quality” application to a place with 50 pre-screens, or 5 applications to places that just want your resume and contact info. I think quantity wins the day.

Again, this strategy is to get “any” job. If you want a job that has cool culture, great pay, cool tech, etc. this is not your strategy, this is to get in, get paid, get some XP and get out when you have time to find a dream job 

Good luck

2. Pursue non-tech interests: Engage in activities outside of programming to diversify your interests. Explore hobbies, sports, arts, or any other non-tech pursuits that you enjoy. This will help you maintain a well-rounded identity beyond programming.

3. Allocate dedicated learning time: Set aside specific time for learning new things related to tech outside of work. It could be a few hours a week or a dedicated day each month. This way, you can focus on personal growth without letting it overshadow other aspects of your life.

4. Socialize with non-tech communities: Interact with people who have different interests"

Godspeed y’all.","The layoffs at top tech companies can have both direct and indirect effects on average developers who don't work at those companies. Here are a few ways how these layoffs can impact them:

1. Increased competition: When top tech companies lay off a significant number of employees, it adds more skilled professionals to the job market. This can lead to increased competition for available positions, making it harder for average developers to secure jobs or negotiate better salaries.

2. Salary pressure: With more experienced developers in the job market due to layoffs, companies may have the upper hand in salary negotiations. They may be able to offer lower salaries or fewer benefits since there are more candidates available to choose from.

3. Job market saturation: The influx of laid-off developers can saturate the job market, making it more challenging for average developers to find suitable employment. This can lead to longer job search periods and potentially even unemployment.

The purpose of that meeting has nothing to do with justifying your work or any lateness.  It is supposed to be where members of the team make each other aware of what they're working on, so they can coordinate anything that might step on each other's toes;  and to let the team know if they have anything blocking their progress so they can get help if needed.

In my experience, hour-long status meetings are the duct tape on the broken window -- it doesn't fix the window, and actually makes it harder to use, but covers up the thing that is broken -- and they usually indicate a project that is very ""waterfall,"" with budget and delivery date bother overrun, and some project manager has been thrust in place to try to get it under control.

On the other hand, witnessing colleagues being laid off could create a sense of uncertainty and job insecurity, potentially leading to a desire to explore other career options or industries that seem more stable.

For impacted individuals (those who were laid off), the experience of being laid off can be devastating.

It states that a class should have only one responsibility or job, and it should not have multiple responsibilities. This principle promotes high cohesion and makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.

2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle encourages designing systems that are easily extensible without modifying the existing code. It promotes the use of abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces to achieve this.

You should have already done that if you're running out of money. Low money is better than no money.

EDIT: Some advice after reviewing your resume:

- The layout is not bad but it's also not fully standard with the column dedicated to the titles, I don't think it's that big of a deal to be honest, but I'd still go with a more standard layout.
- The order of the sections is not good. You should have experience first, education second, and skills third. Some may argue about education VS skills first, but no matter what experience needs to be absolutely first, otherwise it looks like a new grad resume at first glance (and a self-taught one at that, if it's skills first).
- Your bullet points can be improved:
  - I personally don't like the present tense and would recommend using a past tense (""Developed"" VS ""Develop""), especially since they are all past jobs, but this is not that big of a problem.
  - You can refine the description of your jobs where you are underselling yourself. As an example, ""Provide C++ example code and API to customers that demonstrate how to interface with FPGA IP Core"" sounds absolutely trivial, but you can reword it as something like ""Led the definition of interfacing specifications between the customer's developers and the internal tech team on the FPGA IP Core technology"" (you can probably rewrite it better), which describes the same, is entirely truthful, but sounds like a big deal and puts you in light (communication with customers isn't easy). Similarly, make sure to be specific with your metrics. You wrote ""Optimized the previous build automation system by 75%"", which doesn't really mean much. You can rewrite this as ""Implemented a new build automation pipeline which led to a 75% reduction in build and deployment time"".
- Minor point but I would remove the ""(Previously Company Original, acquired 01/2000)"". I imagine you put it because the original name was a famous one, but the truth is that it's an event that was 16 years old by the time you joined.
- I would rework your skill section. If you have only one skill which you are proficient at, I wouldn't put a dedicated ""proficient"" section. I am also sure that you probably know a lot more technologies, such as specific testing frameworks and other stuff.
- Put your phone number. Some people are old school. I hate getting a random call as much as any normal dude, but that's life.

Overall, here is a reference that I like and always share: https://www.careercup.com/resume

We had assumed he was ill, but on the weekend we all received a call from the CEO to say that he had died in a car accident while on his way to the office.

The first day was the worst. We came in on the Monday, and many people were in tears and hysterics. We ended up going for a beer at 10am with someone from HR, with some people going through continued counselling. Most of the day was a complete write-off, but I ended up responding to emails and calls from his work email/phone. What I'll always remember is that we had a deadline for delivery that the boss was spearheading, and after talking to the client to say ""hi, I'm really sorry to say this, but X has passed away and our office is closed while we meet with HR"", their response was ""yeah that's sad and all, but we need this work today, can you get on it?"". After several conference calls with me, our HR, and the client's boss, I ended up delivering this work, and after we were paid we exercised our right to terminate our contract with that client.

We didn't get much done that week, but what I will say is that after that week things did start to pick up again. It's sad to say, but a week after the accident things were almost back to normal. HR did continue speaking to some people afterwards, but normality was restored. We all attended his funeral a few weeks later, and after that, things were basically normal again.

- kotlin is emerging as the enterprise web service lang de jour
- getting the first level solution architecture certificate from AWS is probably wise. It will let you understand system level perspective which will let you come across stronger in interviews (even if it’s a very cursory understanding)

So that means write data structures from scratch in either Java/Python. Nothing crazy, basic list, set, map implementation. When to use a set versus a list, hash buckets, etc 

If I was a new grad and wanted a leg up I would

Good jobs, too. ~250k TC for a step above new grad, ~350k TC for senior. Obviously, it’s nothing like the 2020/2021 hiring booms, but C-suites jumping on this opportunity to make deeper cuts than necessary might be fucking themselves. If so, they’ll eventually have to correct for that, too.

However, I can provide you with some examples of tech stacks that are often considered challenging or outdated:

1. Legacy Systems: Working with outdated technologies and languages that are no longer supported or widely used can be frustrating. Maintaining and updating such systems can be time-consuming and hinder innovation.

2. Monolithic Architecture: Large, complex, and tightly coupled monolithic applications can be difficult to develop, test, and maintain. Scaling and deploying changes can be challenging due to the interdependencies between different components.

3. Incompatible Technologies: Using incompatible technologies within a tech stack can lead to integration issues, making it difficult to share data and communicate between different parts of the system.

4. Inefficient Databases: Working with slow and inefficient databases can significantly impact the performance of an application. If the database is not properly optimized or lacks scalability, it can lead to bottlenecks and poor user experience.

However, I can provide some insights on the topic. The effectiveness of job application approaches can vary depending on the specific circumstances and industries. While a low effort ""spray and pray"" approach (submitting numerous applications without tailoring them to the job requirements) might increase the chances of getting a response, it may not necessarily lead to securing the desired job. On the other hand, a high effort per application approach (customizing each application to fit the requirements, writing personalized cover letters, etc.) can demonstrate genuine interest and dedication to the role, potentially increasing the likelihood of success.

Companies often offer gifts as a gesture of goodwill or appreciation, and accepting the gift implies that you appreciate their gesture.

If you are unsure, it is best to contact the company and ask them directly about their expectations regarding the return of the gift."
